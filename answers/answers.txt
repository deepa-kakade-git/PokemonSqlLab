select count(*) from types;

//What is the name of the pokemon with id 45?
select name from pokemons where id = 45;

select count(*) from pokemons;

//How many types are there?
select count(distict primary_type) from pokemons;

//How many pokemon have a secondary type?
select count(*) from pokemons where secoondary_type is not null;

//Part 3: Joins and Groups
//Directions: Write a sql query or sql queries that can answer the following questions

//What is each pokemon's primary type?
select a.id , a.name , b.name as pokemon_primary_type from pokemons a , types b where a.primary_type = b.id ;

//What is Rufflet's secondary type?
select a.id , a.name , a.secondary_type , b.name from pokemons a , types b where a.secondary_type = b.id and a.name='Rufflet';

//What are the names of the pokemon that belong to the trainer with trainerID 303?
select a.name as pokemon_name , t.trainerID from pokemons a, pokemon_trainer t where t.pokemon_id = a.id and trainerID= 303;

//How many pokemon have a secondary type Poison
select distinct p.id from pokemons p , types t where p.secondary_type=t.id and t.name = 'Poison';


//What are all the primary types and how many pokemon have that type?
select types.name, count(pokemons.id) from types , pokemons where types.id = pokemons.primary_type group by types.name;


//How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemone have? (Hint: your query should not display a trainer
select count(distinct pokemon_id) from pokemon_trainer where pokelevel >=100;
//or
select count(distinct pokemon_id) from pokemon_trainer where trainerid in (select trainerid from pokemon_trainer where pokelevel >= 100) and pokelevel >=100;


//How many pokemon only belong to one trainer and no other?
select count(*) from (select pokemon_id,count(*) ctrainer from  pokemon_trainer group by pokemon_id) a where a.ctrainer=1;
